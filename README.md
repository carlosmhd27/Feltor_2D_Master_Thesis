Abstract

Throughout this work, we present a novel technique to characterize drift-wave and interchange turbulence in the limits of the last closed flux surface. This method is based on the study of the phase relation between electrostatic potential and density as well as between radial velocity and density using the cross power spectral density. 2D simulations, written using FELTOR, of an interchange and the modified Hasegawa-Wakatani models are studied. Using these simulations we are able to measure and provide the differences between drift-wave and interchange instability. When measuring the phase shift between potential and density, we get a 0 rad difference for drift-wave turbulence and $\frac{\pi}{2}$ rad for interchange. When comparing the phase difference between radial transport and density, the results are the opposite, 0 rad for interchange and $\frac{\pi}{2}$ rad for drift-wave. Afterwards, a complete model is proposed where plasma dynamic is studied in the regions around the last closed flux surface, the edge and the scrape-off layer. From these simulations we measure a mixture of interchange and drift-wave turbulence in the limits of the edge region, where the phase relation between radial velocity and density becomes $\frac{\pi}{4}$ rad. This allow us to measure the contribution of both instabilities when they co-exist. Furthermore, we find a change of regime when crossing the last closed flux surface, the phase relation drops to 0 rad at the last closed flux surface, which can be used to measure the position of it. Finally, this technique is applied to state-of-the-art experimental data from the EAST tokamak reactor, where different phase relations are measured at the edge and at the scrape-off layer. The phase relation between electron temperature and floating potential change from $-\pi$ rad in the edge to $-\frac{3\pi}{4}$ rad in the scrape-off layer. This result could be used to locate the last closed flux surface, reducing the cost of this process.

During this work 4 models where implemented to the study of plasma dynamics and turbulence inside a magnetically confinement nuclear fusion reactor, in the boundaries of the Last Closed Flux Surface (LCFS). This models separate the study of Drift-Wave turbulence, in the inner region of the reactor, by using the Hasegawa-Wakatani model @Soren11 @Johan17 --in the ordinary and modified versions--; the study of Interchange turbulence in the Scrape-Off Layer (SOL), using an Interchange model  @Garcia16; and the study of both turbulence interacting together, by using a complete model.
